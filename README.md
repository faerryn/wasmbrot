# wasmbrot
Once upon a time there lived a wistful young boy who longed to look at pastel-colored Mandelbrot sets. He also wanted them to run in a web browser since he wanted to be able to explore the colorful beaches of the Mandelbrot set anywhere he was, so long as he had access to the Internet. He also wanted them to render quickly so that the whole thing was bearable to use. Also, OpenGL makes no sense, so he wanted it to be CPU-based. Did he get what he wanted?
